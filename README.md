# My ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Config

- This is built off of the [starter template for
LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
- I currently use Neovim on Windows Powershell.
- I use the Nerd font version of JetBrains Mono (It's called "[JetBrainsMonoNL
Nerd
Font](https://github.com/CompileArtisan/neovim-configuration/blob/master/JetBrainsMonoNLNerdFont-Regular.ttf)" and is provided in the GitHub Repository).
