# My ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Config

- This is built off of the [starter template for LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
- I currently use Neovim on Windows Powershell
- I use the Nerd font version of JetBrains Mono (called "JetBrainsMonoNL Nerd Font").  
  The .ttf file is provided in the repository.
